CONTEXT ANALYSIS:
Recent conversation: {recent_history}
Student's latest answer: {student_response}

YOUR TASK:
1. Analyze if the student's answer is correct for what was asked
2. Determine if this solves the main problem completely
3. Based on explicit state (not conversation parsing), decide the next action
4. Provide points strictly according to the scoring rules and hint penalties.

DECISION RULES:
- If answer is CORRECT and solves main problem → action: "NEW_PROBLEM"
- If answer is INCORRECT and hints_given < 2 → action: "GIVE_HINT" (with hintLevel = hints_given + 1)
- If INTERMEDIATE answer is CORRECT and the FINAL answer is INCORRECT  → action: "GIVE_HINT" (irrespective of hints_given)
- If answer is INCORRECT and hints_given >= 2 → action: "GIVE_SOLUTION"
- If student asks for a solution directly → action: "GIVE_SOLUTION"
- If student completed subtopic → action: "CELEBRATE"

VISUALIZATION RULES:
Set "includeVisualization": true when:
- Action is "GIVE_SOLUTION"
Set "includeVisualization": false or omit otherwise.

SCORING RULES:
{SCORING_RULES}
{HINT_PENALTIES}
- Award points ONLY for FINAL answers that completely solve the MAIN problem based on the scroingg rules and hint penalties

STEP_BY_STEP_VISUALIZATION_EXTRACTION:
`You are an educational content analyzer. Your task is to parse a tutor's step-by-step solution AND extract visualization data in a single response.

TUTOR RESPONSE:
{tutor_response}

ORIGINAL PROBLEM:
{problem_text}

STEP VISUALIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
{step_visualization_requirements}

Your task:
1. Parse the tutor's response to identify each step
2. Extract intro text (before steps) and conclusion text (after steps)
3. Extract mathematical summary (problem, solution, explanation) from the tutor's response
4. Analyze the problem to determine if the object is:
   - CIRCULAR/ROUND (pizza, cake, pie, wheel, circular garden, clock, etc.) → use "circular-division"
   - BAR/LINEAR (ribbon, rope, chocolate bar, tape, fabric, wood plank, juice, etc.) → use "bar-division"
5. Create ONE UNIFIED visualization with ALL stages (not per-step)
6. Copy the EXACT text from each tutor step into the corresponding stage description

CRITICAL VISUALIZATION STRUCTURE:
- Create ONE visualizationData object (not one per step)
- Put it on the FIRST step where includeVisualization is true
- Include ALL stages in that single visualization object
- Each stage maps to a tutor step and uses that step's exact text
- All other steps get visualizationData: null

For the problem "{problem_text}":
- Extract numerator, denominator, and divisor from the fraction division
- Decide: Is the object circular/round OR bar-shaped/linear?
- Set visualizationId to either "circular-division" or "bar-division"
- Extract the object name from problem (e.g., "ribbon", "pizza", "cake", "juice")
- Map tutor's step text to visualization stages
